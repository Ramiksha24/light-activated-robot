# light-activated-robot

This is a simple, analog robot that follows light using two LDRs and a pair of relays to drive DC motors — no microcontroller needed. This project was featured in **Electronics For You Magazine**, February 2024.

## 🔧 Components Used
- 2 × LDR (Light Dependent Resistors)
- 2 × Transistors (BC547)
- 2 × Relays (6V)
- 2 × DC Motors
- 9V Battery
- Chassis + Wheels
- Resistors, Diodes, Capacitors
- Breadboard / Custom PCB

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- Two LDRs are mounted at the front — left and right.
- If light intensity is higher on one side, that side's transistor conducts and turns **off** that motor.
- This creates a **steering effect**: The robot turns toward the light source.
- When both LDRs detect equal light → Both motors run → Robot moves forward.

## 💡 Key Features
- **No microcontroller** — pure analog logic
- Follows any bright light source (torch, sunlight, phone flash)
- Easy to assemble, beginner-friendly
- Teaches fundamentals of photoconductive sensors & transistor switching
